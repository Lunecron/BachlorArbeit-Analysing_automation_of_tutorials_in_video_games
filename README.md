# Bachlor thesis: Analysing automation of tutorials in video games

**Description:**
This repository houses the codebase for a Bachelor Thesis exploring the automation of tutorials in video games, implemented using Unity and C#. The primary goal is to analyze the effectiveness of automated tutorials compared to traditional, non-automated approaches.

**Key Features:**
- **Parkour Game Prototype:** The heart of the project is a parkour game prototype, serving as a testing ground for automated and non-automated tutorial scenarios.
- **Diverse Mechanics:** The prototype features a variety of game mechanics, ranging from the intuitive to the less obvious, to assess the effectiveness of automation in different scenarios.

**Objective:**
The main objective is to conduct a comprehensive analysis of tutorial automation in video games, using the prototype as a tangible representation. By comparing the experiences of players navigating both automated and non-automated tutorials within the context of a parkour game, the thesis aims to draw insights into the strengths and weaknesses of automation in enhancing the learning experience.
